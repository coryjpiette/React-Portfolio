                  I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and from Penn
                    State
                    University with an MBA in Finance and Supply Chain Management. Iâ€™ve spent the majority of my
                    post-college career working in the financial industry, primarily in fixed income and derivative
                    securities. In 2017 I published my first novel, a techno-thriller titled The Demeter Initiative,
                    which
                    will be rebranded and republished in late 2021. The Demeter Initiative is the first of three
                    intended
                    novels in the Demeter series.
